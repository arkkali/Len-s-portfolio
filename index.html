                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Allen B Alegre but you can call me Len. I
                    don't like being called by my full first name as it is a
                    common name for boys. I am currently 19 years old and will
                    be turning 20 next year August 4. My favorite colors are
                    navy blue, mustard/sunflower yellow and I'm currently into
                    pink. <br />
                    <br />
                    I do love butterflies as they are gorgeous yet they aren't
                    aware of it which makes them more appealing to me. I also
                    love to travel, I love to look at the cities from above but
                    I kinda don't like being part of it. I hate crowded places.
                    I love to be in higher places, it is calming for me to see
                    lights coming from the windows of different people with
                    different stories.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I am currently taking 2nd year in Bachelor of science in
                    information technology major in website and media
                    application. Though this is far from what i can and what i
                    want to do, this is the only option for me right now. Maybe
                    when the time comes, opportunities will come for me to be
                    able to pursue my passion in arts, and my love for real
                    estate and construction. <br />
                    <br />
                    There's this quote that I read a few years ago that I really
                    like and hold onto. It says that "I want to live, I want to
                    see how my story ends. Because I might be aware of what I am
                    but what can become of me is still unknown and I am trying
                    to end up something endearing and warm."

                    <p>
                        This tool introduce me to html, css, and javascript
                        language. It helps me learn how to create and design a
                        website. Additionally it also helps me in learning
                        database sql.

                    <h3>Android Studio</h3>
                    <p>
                        In VSCode I learn how to create a website, meanwhile in
                        Android studio I learn how to create and design an
                        application. Both tool have similar UI which makes it a
                        lot easier to use.

                    <h3>Canva</h3>
                    <p>
                        I use Canva to create visual designs like posters,
                        mockups, and school related projects. When programming,
                        I use it to design UI layouts, icons, and graphics that
                        I later implement into my projects to make them look
                        clean and professional.

                    <h3>Eclipse</h3>
                    <p>
                        I use Eclipse to write and run my Java programs. It
                        helps me spot errors easily and makes coding simpler
                        with features like auto-complete and project
                        organization. It's a helpful tool when I'm still
                        learning and building small programs.

                    <h3>Figma</h3>
                    <p>
                        I want to learn Figma because it's a tool used for
                        designing websites and apps. It helps create layouts,
                        buttons, and page structures before actually coding
                        them. Learning it will help me plan and design my
                        websites better before I start developing them.

                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>
                        I want to learn Python because it's easy to understand
                        and great for beginners. It can be used in many areas
                        like web development, automation, and data analysis.
                        Learning it will help me get better at programming and
                        build useful projects.
